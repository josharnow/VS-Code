# Indentation Practice

## Use `git` & `github` to set up this assignment
1. Fork the repo
2. Use `git clone <repo url>` to clone the repo on your computer
3. Use your text editor to properly indent the html
4. Use `git` to `commit` and `push` the changes to your forked repo
5. Submit the assignment using the `github` link 

## Set up your editor:

We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Start Coding

Please fix this very ugly code!

Open in your Text Editor (VS Code) and properly indent the code in `partI.html`.

Please note that most of the tags in the code below have not been discussed yet. But at this point, you already know what opening and closing tags look like. Without knowing the HTML tags, determine what the parents, children, and siblings are by properly indenting the code in `partII.html`.
